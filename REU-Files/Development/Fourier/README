COMPILING:$ ifort -o fourier-omp -openmp fourier-omp.f
RUNNING:$ ./fourier-omp # expects input file fort.1; outputs to fort.2 

This code was written by Dr. Bartschat and is designed to take a field in the time domain and convert it to the frequency domain.

The files in this directory are NOT used when running jobs. Rather the fourirer transform code was added to the main code, work15b-all.f. You can find this in the work15b-all code within the subroutine PULSEKB (around line 2224 as of May 1st, 2014).  

There shouldn't be any reason to edit this code unless something bad happens to the work15b-all code.
